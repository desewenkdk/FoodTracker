building IOS app following Apple official tutorial

## Signal SIGABRT has appeard...
* check these.
  * You created a new view controller in Interface Builder, and set it up with a few UI elements like buttons and labels
  
  * You connected these UI elements to your code by using outlet properties, which creates a connection between a property of your view controller and the UI element in Interface Builder
  
  * At one point *you changed the name* of the initial outlet property and your app started crashing with a SIGABRT error!!
  
  * Or, you maybe add outlet, and *delete just on code*, *property is still alive in storyboard*

## Connect the UI to code

### Target-action Pattern
![target-action](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Art/CUIC_sim_defaulttext_2x.png)
* 1. The event is the user **tapping the Set Default Text button.**

* 2. The *action* is *setDefaultLabelText(_).*

* 3. The *target* is *ViewController* (where the **action method is defined**).

* 4. The *sender* is the *Set Default Label Text button.*

### Process User Input - UITextFieldDelegate
* By adopting the UITextFieldDelegate protocol, you tell the compiler that the ViewController class can act as a valid text field delegate. This means you can implement the protocolâ€™s methods to handle text input, and you can assign instances of the ViewController class as the delegate of the text field.
'''swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()
// Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
nameTextField.delegate = self/*ViewController class itself*/;
}
'''

'''swift
func textFieldShouldReturn(_ textField: UITextField) -> Bool {
//Hide the Keyboard
textField.resignFirstResponder()
return true
}

* Tab textfields-> textfield becomes a *first responder* -> displays keyboard, get inputs -> after typing, keyboard must disappear, ->taps a button to end editing in the text field. You do this in the textFieldShouldReturn(_:) method, which gets called when the user taps Return (or in this case, Done) on the keyboard.
    * Object that is first on the line for receiving many kinds of app events, including key events, motion events, and action messages, among others.

/*
The textFieldDidEndEditing(_:) method gives you a chance to read the information entered into the text field and do something with it.
*/
func textFieldDidEndEditing(_ textField: UITextField){
mealNameLabel.text = textField.text
}

*func textFieldShouldReturn(_ textField: UITextField) -> Bool { *
